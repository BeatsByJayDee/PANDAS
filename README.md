# PANDAS
This is a series of ipython notebooks for analyzing Big Data -- specifically Twitter data -- using Python's powerful <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/" target=_blank>PANDAS</a> (Python Data Analysis) library. 

For these tutorials I am assuming you have already downloaded the data and are now ready to begin examining it. In this first notebook I will show you how to set up your ipython working environment and import the Twitter data we have downloaded. If you are new to Python, you may wish to go through a <a href="http://social-metrics.org/tutorial-list/" target=_blank>series of tutorials</a> I have created in order. 

If you want to skip the data download and just use the sample data, but don't yet have Python set up on your computer, you may wish to go through the tutorial <a href="http://social-metrics.org/python-code-prerequisites/" target=_blank>"Setting up Your Computer to Use My Python Code"</a>.

Also note that we are using the <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html" target=_blank>iPython notebook interactive computing framework</a> for running the code in this tutorial. If you're unfamiliar with this see this tutorial <a href="http://social-metrics.org/starting-on-python-2/" target=_blank>"Four Ways to Run your Code"</a>.

For a more general set of PANDAS notebook tutorials, I'd recommend <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/22/cooking-with-pandas/" target=_blank>this one by Julia Evans</a>.
