# PANDAS
This is a series of ipython notebooks for analyzing Big Data -- specifically Twitter data -- using Python's powerful <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/" target=_blank>PANDAS</a> (Python Data Analysis) library. 

For these tutorials I am assuming you have already downloaded the data and are now ready to begin examining it. In this first notebook I will show you how to set up your ipython working environment and import the Twitter data we have downloaded. If you are new to Python, you may wish to go through a <a href="http://social-metrics.org/tutorial-list/" target=_blank>series of tutorials</a> I have created in order.
